### Planning

![ERD](https://i.imgur.com/x6Ljwav.png)

First, I created an ERD diagram listing the models I planned to create for my website. After listing them out, I assigned several keys I thought my final models would hold.

Next, I created a Trello board for my project, detailing key user stories that would define the scope of my project. 

My main focus was to create a website that used all the CRUD operations and RESTful routes.

### Future Updates

I have already begun planning future updates to my project where I can look to make the user experience even better.

- [ ] Create an "advanced search" feature to look at multiple keys concurrently
- [ ] Create a favoriting system where users can add racquets to their favorites
- [ ] Add a comparison feature allowing users to add multiple racquets to a comparison screen to more easily see specs side-by-side
